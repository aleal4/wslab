          <p>Our laboratory is interested in understanding how insects perceive the world through the sense of smell. Insect prominence among other animals is due in large part to a sophisticated olfactory system, which can selectively detect minute amounts of odorants. We aimed at unraveling the molecular mechanisms underpinning selectivity and sensitivity. Our goal is not only to advance our understanding of fundamental biology, but also to exploit the molecular basis of insect chemical communication for the development of environmentally friendly strategies for monitoring, controlling, and surveillance of insect vectors. One of the main objectives is to “identify approaches that will help control or prevent the transmission of vector-borne pathogens to humans.” This goal is in line with the mission of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) – the major sponsor of our research program. We focus mainly on the Southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, which vectors pathogens causing filariasis, West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, and Rift Valley fever. We use a multi-disciplinary approach that includes bioinformatics, molecular methods, RNAi & CRISPR/Cas9 silencing, sensory physiology techniques, and behavioral measurements. Ultimately, we test in the field newly developed oviposition attractants, repellents, and insect trapping systems.
